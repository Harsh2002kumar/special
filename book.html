          <p>
            From the moment we started talking, you‚Äôve been on my mind in the
            best way. There‚Äôs something about you‚Äîyour kindness, your energy,
            just the way you are‚Äîthat feels so special to me. You make my days
            brighter and put a smile on my face without even trying. I don‚Äôt
            know what the future holds, but I do know one thing‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to have
            you by my side. So, here‚Äôs my question, straight from the heart‚Ä¶
            will you be mine? üíñüíï
